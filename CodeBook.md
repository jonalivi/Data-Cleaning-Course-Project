This file contains the description of the file `./data/tidydata.txt`.

The file represents a table with column names in the first row and 180 observations of 88 variables.

* activity - a character variable describing the type of the activity performed by the subject, which can have one of the six values: "laying", "sitting", "standing", "walking", "walking downstairs", "walking upstairs"

* subject - an integer variable corresponding to the id of the subject who performed the experiment. Varies in the range from 1 to 30

The variables listed below have double values corresponding to the values of the variables in the parentheses averaged on all observations with activity from the `activity` column for the `subject` subject. They range from -1 to 1:
